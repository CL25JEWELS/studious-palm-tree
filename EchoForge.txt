COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
-----------------------

We're NOT competing with:
- Professional DAWs (Ableton, Logic, FL Studio) - too complex, desktop-only
- Notation software (Sibeone, Finale) - different use case
- Audio editors (Audacity, Adobe Audition) - different workflow

We ARE an alternative to:
- Launchpad/Novation Grid apps - but cross-platform and more powerful
- GarageBand - but focused on loops and faster workflow
- Soundtrap/BandLab - but better performance and offline-first

Our differentiators:
- Sub-10ms latency (performance-grade)
- Cross-platform from day one
- Offline-first with optional cloud
- Social remix features baked in
- Free and open sound library
- One-click sharing

TECHNICAL PHILOSOPHY
-------------------

1. Web-First, Not Web-Only
   - Start with web to maximize reach
   - Progressive enhancement for native apps
   - Share code across platforms
   - Native performance where it matters

2. Offline-First
   - Works without internet
   - Local storage is primary
   - Cloud is optional enhancement
   - No vendor lock-in

3. Performance is a Feature
   - Audio latency is non-negotiable
   - Smooth 60fps UI
   - Instant feedback on every interaction
   - Optimize for perceived performance

4. Open but Sustainable
   - Open-source core engine
   - Proprietary cloud/social features
   - Community sound packs
   - Fair pricing model

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

   - Advanced features behind tap/click
   - Defaults should sound good
   - Easy to start, hard to master

3. Visual Feedback
   - Every action has immediate visual response
   - Sound is visualized (waveforms, meters)
   - State is always clear
   - Errors are gentle and helpful

4. Consistency
   - Patterns repeat across features
   - Same gesture = same result
   - Visual language is cohesive
   - Cross-platform consistency

GUIDING QUESTIONS
----------------

For every feature/decision, ask:
1. Does this help users make music faster?
2. Does this add unnecessary complexity?
3. Will this work on all target platforms?
4. Does this align with our values?
5. Would our primary personas use this?

If the answer to 1, 3, 4, or 5 is "no," reconsider.
If the answer to 2 is "yes," simplify or cut.

Remember: Our mission is to make music creation accessible, powerful, and joyful. Every decision should serve that mission.
